 # The anatomy of SVG
 
- `viewBox` - x, y, width, and height
- SVG also stores information outside the viewBox area
- `preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet"`, is what most people will want more than 9 times out of 10. 
  This forces the drawing area to adjust itself with uniform scaling.
- `meet` vs `slice`
  - `meet` like `background-size: contain`
  - 'slice' like `background-size: cover`
  
## preserveAspectRatio

- `none` - Do not force uniform scaling.
- `xMinYMin` - similar to `backrgound-position: 0% 0%`
- `xMinYMid` - similar to `background-position: 0% 50%`
- `xMinYMax` - similar to `backrgound-position: 0% 100%`
- `xMidYMin` - similar to `backrgound-position: 50% 0%`
- `xMidYMid (The default value)` - similar to `backrgound-position: 50% 50%`
- `xMidYMax` - `backrgound-position: 50% 100%`
- `xMaxYMin` - `backrgound-position: 100% 0%`
- `xMaxYMid` - `backrgound-position: 100% 50%`
- `xMaxYMax` - `backrgound-position: 100% 100%`
