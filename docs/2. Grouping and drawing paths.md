# Grouping and drawing paths

- `<g>` attributes applies to all elements inside it.
- You should keep this XML markup because leaving it out can cause issues in older browsers:
  `xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"`

```css
.ball {
  animation-name: animation-name-you-pick;
  animation-duration: 2s;
  animation-delay: 2s;
  animation-iteration-count: 3;
  animation-direction: alternate;
  animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
  animation-fill-mode: forwards;
}

.ball {
  animation: animation-name-you-pick 2s 2s 3 alternate ease-in-out forwards;
}
```

- To animate cheaply, your best bet is to use transforms and opacity.
-  SVG DOM elements are currently hardware-accelerated only in some browsers
